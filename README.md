# Titanic-project-
Using TensorFlow and APIs
Project on using tensorflow on titanic
1. Data Preparation
The purpose of the Titanic dataset is to predict whether the given passengers could be survived after Titinic hit the iceburg titanic, according to their personal information.

We usually use DataFrame from the pandas library to pre-process the structured data.

2. Model Definition
Usually there are three ways of modeling using APIs of Keras: sequential modeling using Sequential() function, arbitrary modeling using API functions, and customized modeling by inheriting base class Model.

Here we take the simplest way: sequential modeling using function Sequential().

3. Model Training
There are three usual ways for model training: use internal function fit, use internal function train_on_batch, and customized training loop. Here we introduce the simplist way: using internal function fit.

# Model Training 
training and validation loss and accuracy of the model respectively.
